# ðŸŽ¥ Video Animation

To play a video when it enters the scroll port, you can insert an Animation Group and then insert Video Animation inside it. Upload a short video directly to Webstudio and select it in the Video instance inside Video Animation. The video will start playing according to the Animation Group settings once the video reaches a certain position in the scroll port.

Video Animation is one component of the animation engine. See [Animations](../foundations/animations.md) for an overview.

{% hint style="info" %}
Just remember that you'll need to wrap the Video Animation component in an Animation Group to define and control the actual animation behavior. The Animation Group must be the **direct** **parent** of the Video Animation.
