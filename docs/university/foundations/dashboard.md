# 🏠 Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging into Webstudio. It provides an overview of all your projects and templates, with powerful features for organization and quick access.

---

## Search

The Dashboard includes a unified search feature that helps you quickly find projects and templates across your entire workspace.

### How to Use Search

1. Click the search field in the left sidebar or start typing directly
2. Type your search query to filter projects by name
3. Use arrow keys to navigate through search results
4. Press Enter to open the selected project

The search works across both your projects and starter templates, displaying results in a dedicated search view. This allows you to find any project regardless of which section you're currently viewing.

{% hint style="info" %}
Search is performed client-side for instant results, making it snappy even with many projects.

## Project Tags

Tags help you organize and categorize your projects for easier management. This is especially useful when you have many projects and need to group them by client, project type, status, or any other criteria.

### Creating and Managing Tags

1. Hover over a project card and click the tag icon (or access via the project menu)
2. Click "Create new tag" to add a new tag
3. Enter a tag name and select a color
4. Tags are automatically saved when you select them

### Tag Features

- **Color-coded tags** – Each tag can have a distinct color for visual organization
- **Multiple tags per project** – Assign as many tags as needed to a single project
- **Filter by tags** – Click a tag in the sidebar to filter projects by that tag
- **Edit tags** – Rename or change the color of existing tags
- **Delete tags** – Remove tags you no longer need

Tags appear on project cards, making it easy to see project categories at a glance.

---

## View Options

The Dashboard supports two different view layouts to suit your preference:

### Grid View (Card View)

The default view displays projects as visual cards with:

- Project thumbnail/preview
- Project name
- Custom domain (if configured)
- Assigned tags
- Quick action buttons

### List View

A compact view that displays projects in rows with:

- Project thumbnail (smaller)
- Project name
- Domain information
- Tags
- Last published date
- Created date

Switch between views using the view toggle buttons in the toolbar.

---

## Sorting Projects

Projects can be sorted in multiple ways to help you find what you need:

- **Last published** – Projects sorted by most recent publication date
- **Last edited** – Projects sorted by most recent changes (default)
- **Name (A-Z)** – Alphabetically ascending
- **Name (Z-A)** – Alphabetically descending
- **Date created** – Projects sorted by creation date

Click the sort dropdown in the toolbar to change the sorting order. Your preference is remembered across sessions.

---

## Custom Domain Display

When a project has a custom domain configured, the domain is displayed on the project card. This makes it easy to identify which projects are live and what their public URLs are without opening each project.

The domain display shows:

- Custom domain (e.g., `example.com`) if configured
- Default Webstudio subdomain otherwise

---

## Project Settings from Dashboard

You can access project settings directly from the Dashboard without opening the Builder:

1. Click the menu icon (three dots) on a project card
2. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
3. Edit project settings in the dialog that appears

This allows you to quickly update project metadata, configure redirects, manage custom code, and adjust other settings without loading the full Builder interface.

---

## Project Actions

From the Dashboard, you can perform several actions on your projects:

### Quick Actions (hover over card)

- **Open** – Open the project in the Builder
- **Tags** – Manage project tags
- **Menu** – Access more options

### Menu Actions

- **Settings** – Open project settings dialog
- **Duplicate** – Create a copy of the project
- **Share** – Create a share link
- **Delete** – Remove the project (with confirmation)

---

## Starter Templates

The Templates section of the Dashboard provides access to pre-built project templates that you can clone and customize:

1. Navigate to the "Templates" section in the sidebar
2. Browse available templates
3. Click a template to preview it
4. Clone it to create your own project based on that template

Templates are searchable using the same unified search feature.
