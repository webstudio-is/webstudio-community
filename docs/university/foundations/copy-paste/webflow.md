  Webstudio supports pasting Webflow Elements, converting them from Webflow
  format to Webstudio format.

It works by copying anything in Webflow format, such as component libraries and projects, and pasting it into Webstudio, transferring the structure and styles.

## What does and doesn’t transfer

### Styles

✅ Both Webflow and Webstudio support all CSS properties, allowing all styles defined in the style panel to transfer.

✅ Webflow preset styles, which Webflow adds by default to pages and Elements.

❌ Webflow variables and their values do not transfer as those values are not available within the Webflow copy.

❌ User-defined styles on **global tag selectors** as they are not available in the Webflow copy. For example, global styling on an H1 does not transfer, but a Token of h1 is created and available for applying the styles.

### Classes

✅ Classes and combo classes will transfer as [Tokens](../design-tokens.md) with their respective styles.

{% hint style="success" %}
Pasting a class/Token that already exists will not cause duplication or override it.
{% endhint %}

### Breakpoints

✅ Responsive styles and breakpoints will transfer.

### Interactions

❌ Interactions and animations do not transfer.
