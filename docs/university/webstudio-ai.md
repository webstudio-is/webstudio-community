# 🤖 Webstudio AI

Webstudio AI has been discontinued and is no longer maintained.

Separately, the Webstudio team has launched [Inception](https://wstd.us/inception) — a **standalone product** designed specifically for creative design exploration, powered by a much more advanced AI foundation.

Inception is **not** a new version of Webstudio AI and **not** a replacement for it. Webstudio AI was an experimental open-source project; Inception is a completely independent tool with a different purpose and workflow.

### ❗ Important clarification: Inception is _not_ the replacement for the builder’s AI

Some users assumed that Inception replaced the AI inside the Webstudio builder — but that’s not the case.

We removed the old builder AI because it was outdated, low-usage, and no longer delivering value. It wasn’t removed to make room for Inception, and the two products are unrelated.

A **new AI system for the builder** will be introduced in the future, but it is being rebuilt from the ground up and will be integrated directly into the builder itself.

### ❓ Is Inception included in existing plans?

**Short answer: No — Inception is not included in any existing plan.** This applies to lifetime deals, monthly subscriptions, and all previous purchases.

Inception is its own product, with its own pricing, because it uses the most advanced models available today — models that are significantly more expensive to run than the older generation.

### 🧠 What happened to the old AI assistant in the builder?

The previous AI assistant (originally released in 2023 using GPT-4) no longer made sense to maintain:

* it was barely used
* it didn’t reflect the capabilities of today’s AI
* modern agentic, reasoning-capable models require an entirely new architecture

Rather than keeping outdated AI code alive, we’re **rewriting the entire AI layer** for the builder.

The upcoming version will:

* support **multiple AI models**
* include at least one **free or very low-cost option**
* offer access to advanced models like **Claude** when needed
* introduce a **chat interface** directly in the builder, enabling visual actions and more
