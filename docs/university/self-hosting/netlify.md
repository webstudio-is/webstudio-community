# ▶️ Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a popular choice for deploying modern websites and apps, offers features like continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network, serverless form handling, and more. It provides an ideal environment for deploying your Webstudio Projects.

**Netlify supports deploying both dynamic apps and static sites.**

### Prerequisites

- Install the [Webstudio CLI](cli.md)

Use the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) to deploy your app directly to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/):

```bash
netlify deploy
```

You can configure the project to support Netlify serverless/edge-functions respectively, as deployment target at the time of initially setting up your project. Please check the [initiating-a-webstudio-project](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio/tree/main/packages/cli#initiating-a-webstudio-project) section.

You can manually change it using the `build` command. For serverless functions:

```bash
webstudio build --template netlify
```

### Complete CLI Workflow

Here's the full step-by-step process for deploying to Netlify:

```bash
# 1. Create a Webstudio project folder
npx webstudio

# Follow prompts: enter folder name, paste your Share Link

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd your-project-folder

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Login to Netlify
npx netlify-cli login

# 5. Create a new Netlify site
npx netlify-cli sites:create

# 6. Build your project
npm run build

# 7. Deploy to preview URL (for testing)
npx netlify-cli deploy

# 8. Deploy to production (when ready)
npx netlify-cli deploy --prod
```

### Redeploying Changes

When you make changes in Webstudio:

1. Publish changes in Webstudio
2. In your project folder, run:
   ```bash
   npx webstudio sync
   npm run build
   npx netlify-cli deploy --prod
   ```
