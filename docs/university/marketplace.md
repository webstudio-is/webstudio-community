# Marketplace

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/marketplace.png" alt="Webstudio Marketplace in the Builder" width="288"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The Marketplace contains more templates than what's shown in the Dashboard. The Dashboard shows starter Projects, while the Builder shows everything in the Dashboard, plus pages and sections.
{% endhint %}

## Types of templates

### **Pages**

Page templates are pre-designed single or multi-page layouts for entire pages. Upon selection, a new page will be inserted into your Project.

### **Integrations**

Integration templates are [pages](marketplace.md#pages) with preconfigured [Resources](foundations/variables.md#resource), such as Airtable, Notion, Ghost, Baserow, and more.

Blog templates, for example, typically include pages like:

* Posts
* Post
* Author
* Tag
* Sitemap

Integration templates are typically unstyled or minimally styled, allowing you to apply your own design while providing the backend API connections.

### **Sections**

Section templates are pre-designed layouts for quickly creating pages from sections. Upon selection, the section is inserted into the current page.

## Webflow Ecosystem Compatibility

Webstudio supports templates, component libraries, and projects from the Webflow ecosystem, allowing you to copy from Webflow and paste into Webstudio. Learn more about [Copy Paste](foundations/copy-paste/webflow.md).

## Contributing to the Marketplace

You can contribute free or paid templates by creating a project and submitting it for review.
