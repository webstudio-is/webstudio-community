# How to build a frontend for Supabase using Webstudio

In Webstudio, a "Collection" is a powerful feature designed to manage and display dynamic content on web pages. Essentially, they serve as containers that can connect to various data sources, like databases or APIs, to fetch and present data in a structured and repeatable manner. This allows developers and designers to create instances, such as lists, galleries, or testimonial sections, where each item in the collection is automatically populated with data from the connected source. By using a collection, Webstudio users can efficiently create pages with content that updates in real-time, reflecting changes in the data source without manual intervention, thereby enhancing the site's interactivity and relevance.

### Mapping Data and Finalizing Your Page

Map the data from Supabase to your Webstudio project. This involves setting up the data within your collection to inform Webstudio about the available data for use.

- Delete any automatically generated preview box within the collection.
- Drag in your pre-created and pre-styled components, which will be repeated for each fetched item from Supabase.
- For each component (e.g., paragraph, field, and image), bind the corresponding data from your Supabase collection.
- Use `.data` to access the actual content (e.g., `resource.data`)
- When binding inside a Collection, use `collectionItem` instead of the resource name
- Once everything is connected and data is properly mapped, your page will dynamically display the testimonials stored in Supabase.

Make sure to check the responsiveness and appearance on mobile devices before publishing.
