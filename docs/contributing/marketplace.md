# Contributing to the Marketplace

## Submission Process

### **1. Create a Project**

Create a Project with a page per section or page you want to make available.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When creating sections, ensure there is one parent wrapper for the entire section, as only the first wrapper is inserted when sections are inserted. The Body and its styles are only inserted on pages, not sections.
{% endhint %}

### **2. Submit the Project**

Navigate to Project Settings > Marketplace, fill out the required fields, select whether your Project includes pages, sections, or integrations, and submit it for review.

Once it’s submitted, Page Settings will now have the following options you can immediately use:

* **Include in Marketplace**: Toggle on or off.
* **Category**: Optionally categorize your pages/sections (e.g., "Contact" if offering various Contact sections/pages).
* **Marketplace Preview**: Add an optional preview image. If none is provided, the page/section name will be displayed.

## Selling Templates

To sell templates, follow the same submission process but include a page with purchasing instructions and a checkout link. Ensure purchases provide immediate access to the template via a Share link so they can clone it. You can redirect your buyers to the Project or send an automated email. Please include “(Paid)” at the end of the template name.
